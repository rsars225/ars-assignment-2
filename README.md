This repository is a collection of my chosen works that reflect my views of the Anthropocene concept. Rather than focusing on mostly nature and the world around us. many of my photos are from personal belongings, much of which are quite artiifical things. This is because my photos meant to reflect that not are artificial creations necessarily done with harmful intent, or to overtake nature, but rather to imitate it because not all parts of nature can be taken by humans. Flowers, insects, prints and patterns, fake insects, are all a reflection of human appreciation of nature, even though it may not seem that way at first. The photos were not edited too much. The main colors I wanted to bring out were greens and in some photos, browns/beiges. The saturation for "artificial" things were increased to emphasize that it was just an imitation of nature.
